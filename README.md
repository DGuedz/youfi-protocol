YouFi Protocol - Hedera Hello Future: Origins Hackathon 2025
Transform financial discipline into digital assets using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) on Hedera Hashgraph

Hedera SBT Open Finance AI License Build Status

Problem Statement
Over 140 million Brazilians lack financial discipline, with traditional banking systems offering no rewards for consistent behavior or contextual guidance for achieving personal financial goals. The disconnect between intention and action in financial planning costs individuals billions in unrealized dreams and economic potential.

Solution
YouFi Protocol is the world's first blockchain-based system that transforms personal financial goals into Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) on Hedera Hashgraph. By creating verifiable, non-transferable digital assets representing commitments, users build an immutable on-chain reputation score that unlocks exclusive DeFi opportunities, better interest rates, and community-driven financial support.

Key Innovation: "Seu compromisso é seu patrimônio"
("Your commitment is your wealth")
